Since our first school branch expanded in 2002 into a chain of more than 60 international schools, we have impacted the lives of more than 50,000 students and established a new standard for educational excellence. 'Shaping minds, touching lives, building second homes' is the school's motto. Along with academic performance, we place a high focus on personality development, creative approach, future-oriented and collaborative learning.
